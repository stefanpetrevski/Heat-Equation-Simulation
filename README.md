# Heat-Equation-Simulation
A project from my undergraduate education in Oxford towards the Prelims Computational Mathematics course. 
It implements a finite-difference method to simulate solutions to the heat equation in one dimension.  It also explores a more complicated configuration.
Namely, it deals with the Allen-Cahn equation, which is a reaction-diffusion PDE closely related to the usual heat equation.

The main file is projectB.m, which is compiled as projectB.pdf. It calls on all the other auxiliary files, which form the backbone of the procedure.
